# Purpose

The goal of this section of Project 3 is to allow you to demonstrate your understanding of query tuning and schema in a MySQL database.

*Important* - Not every candidate will have direct MySQL experience. That is okay. Google away against your RDBMS of expertise. You goal is to show us you can _translate_ RDBMS expertise from one vendor to another.

*Important* - The term "busy environment" will be used frequently. For the purpose of this discussion, busy is 

* 30,000 queries per second. 
* Tables are both wide and deep and we will ask you to extrapolate about this
* Bonus - we have a rare workload of 90% write, 10% read. If you are able to converse about this situation it would be extra impressive.

Choose three(3) of the queries and tune them. Be ready to talk about the following:

* Why did you choose those three challenges?
* Why did you choose to show code changes the way you did?
* What lead you to tune what you did, and what do you expect the effect would be in a busy environment?
* What sort of impact does a recommended change have on a development team and their code base?
* How would you work with a developer or dev team to understand the need for the change and how to recognize such opportunities on their own?
