# Infrastructure Hire Project

# Overview

At Contrast, we like to play hard, work hard, and automate our SaaS environment end to end.

We have project options to choose from so our candidates can showcase their skills and give us a better idea of their individual talents!

# Project 1

We use ECS Fargate and Python for automating tasks or even run small services [Project 1](./project1/README.md) focuses on deploying a Flask application to ECS Fargate using CloudFormation (or Terraform if you wish!).

The idea behind this project is for candidates to explore AWS technologies and maybe even learn a few! There's plenty of room for candidates to put their personal touch on this project, feel free to explore and show us what they are passionate about.

# Project 2

We use Kubernetes to orchestrate our containers. [Project 2](./project2/README.md) focuses on deploying a small Python application to EKS using Terraform.

The idea behind this project is for candidates to showcase their knowledge of Python, Kubernetes, AWS, and Terraform. Just like project 1, we welcome candidates to think outside the box and show us what they are passionate about.

# Project 3

We use MySQL as one of our main data stores. Since MySQL generally needs to be tuned from both a system and application perspective, [Project 3](./project3/README.md) focuses on creating an RDS instance, optimizing the database configuration via parameter changes, and tuning some poorly performing queries.

The idea behind this project is for candidates to showcase their knowledge of MySQL. Just like project 1, we welcome candidates to think outside the box and show us what they are passionate about.

# Feedback

We love feedback. PR or create issues on this repository with feedback on what we could do better!
